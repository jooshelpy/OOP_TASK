<h1>Army Simulation Project</h1>

This is an Army Simulation Project that demonstrates basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using C++. The project simulates an army consisting of soldiers and vehicles, each with unique abilities and functionalities.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

The Army Simulation Project aims to showcase how to design and implement a simple simulation using OOP principles. It consists of soldiers, each with a special ability, and vehicles, each with unique functionality. The project's main goal is to issue commands to the army and observe how soldiers and vehicles respond to those commands.

<h2>Features</h2>
-Creation of soldiers with unique abilities.\
-Configuration of vehicles with specific capacities.\
-Issuing various commands to the army:\
    Attack: Initiates an attack action for soldiers.\
    Move: Moves vehicles.\
    Report: Provides a report on soldiers' abilities and vehicle deployment.\

<h2>Commands</h2>

The following commands are available in the simulation:\

Attack: Initiates an attack action for soldiers.\
Move: Moves vehicles.\
Report: Provides a report on soldiers' abilities and vehicle deployment.    \
